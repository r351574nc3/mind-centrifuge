# Reactive Feature Additions / Realtime Plugin Subsystem


## Motivation

Uptime is very important for applications. It's desirable for applications to remain running even after release or updates. It is possible to design a system that can remain running as features are added to it. This is a subsystem that is an abstraction from the parent application or service. It allows arbitrary functionality to be added or removed without coupling.
